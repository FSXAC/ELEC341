# ELEC341 Design Project
PID Control Project in MATLAB and Simulink

Refer to the project description [here](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/~leos/pdf/e341/proj/Proj17.pdf)!

## Introduction

### Project Description

#### Part I

Modifying the SimuLink files

- [x] Develop models to compute the **direct** and **inverse** kinematics of the wrist



Modifying `system.m` file

- [ ] Model the OP AMP transfer function
- [ ] Model the electrical dynamics function
- [ ] Model the mechanical dynamics function

#### Part II

- [ ] Select best motor for each joint
- [ ] Design a **PID** controller that *minimizes the build time* without exceeding the maximum build error
- [ ] Modify the time vector to help achieve the desired output
