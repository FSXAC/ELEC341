# ELEC341 Design Project
PID Control Project in MATLAB and Simulink

Refer to the project description [here](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/~leos/pdf/e341/proj/Proj17.pdf)!

## Introduction

### Project Description

#### Part I

- [ ] Develop models to compute the **direct** and **inverse** kinematics of the wrist
- [ ] Model the dynamics of the robotic wrist, including all electronics, motors, and mechanisms.

#### Part II

- [ ] Select best motor for each joint
- [ ] Design a **PID** controller that *minimizes the build time* without exceeding the maximum build error
- [ ] Modify the time vector to help achieve the desired output
