# ELEC341 Design Project
PID Control Project in MATLAB and Simulink

Refer to the project description [here](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/~leos/pdf/e341/proj/Proj17.pdf)!

## Introduction

### Project Description

### Tasks

#### Part I

Modify `printer.slx`

- [x] Develop models to compute the **direct** and **inverse** kinematics of the wrist



Modifying `system.m` file

- [ ] Model the OP AMP transfer function

- [ ] Model the electrical dynamics function

- [ ] Model the mechanical dynamics function

      For this part, we might need to refer to the [moment of inertia equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_moments_of_inertia) and [motor equations](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/~leos/pdf/e341/handouts/desproj/MaxonSpecs.pdf)

#### Part II

- [ ] Select best motor for each joint
- [ ] Design a **PID** controller that *minimizes the build time* without exceeding the maximum build error
- [ ] Modify the time vector to help achieve the desired output
